# Check-Yo-Self

This is a checklist app made using Javascript, CSS and HTML. It utilizes local storage, object manipulation, a liquid layout, media queries, as well as a well structured UI.

 This project was built in 3 days and had many challenging aspects, I learned a lot about local storage, button validation, and attribute manipulation.
